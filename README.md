## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- Learned a lot about building from mobile view to tablet view and then to desktop view. Especially the decisions you make with how you build the semantic HTML can really haunt you in different media queries if not thought out.

- Learned about CSS filter for changing svg backgrounds. That was AWESOME!
